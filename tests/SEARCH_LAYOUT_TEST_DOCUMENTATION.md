# Search Layout Stability Test Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive test suite created to ensure search functionality and layout stability work correctly across all tab operations in the Electron Markdown Reader.

## Test Files Created

### 1. search-layout-stability.test.js
**Purpose:** Tests for search layout stability and DOM preservation  
**Coverage:**
- Content Position Stability
  - Maintains content position when search overlay is shown/hidden
  - Preserves scroll position during search highlighting
  - Maintains layout when clearing search highlights
- CSS Class Management for Layout Stability
  - Maintains `has-document-content` class during search operations
  - Properly excludes welcome content from document-specific styling
- Scrollbar Stability
  - Tests `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to prevent layout shift
- Search Highlighting Performance
  - Tests multiple search operations for performance
- DOM Structure Preservation
  - Preserves original DOM structure after search operations
  - Handles nested elements correctly during highlighting

### 2. tab-layout-management.test.js
**Purpose:** Tests for CSS class management and tab layout behavior  
**Coverage:**
- CSS Class Management
  - Proper addition/removal of `has-document-content` class
  - CSS class behavior during tab switching
- Welcome Tab Layout
  - Welcome content centering
  - Recent files handling (with and without files)
- Document Tab Layout
  - Document content wrapping
  - Empty document handling
- Layout Switching Behavior
  - Transitions between welcome and document layouts
- CSS Display Mode Consistency
  - Consistent display properties based on content type
  - Prevention of inline style conflicts

### 3. search-state-management.test.js
**Purpose:** Tests for search state persistence and DOM preservation across tabs  
**Coverage:**
- Search State Persistence
  - Saving search state when switching tabs
  - Restoring search state when returning to tabs
  - Proper search state clearing
- DOM Preservation During Search
  - Original DOM structure preservation during highlighting
  - Nested elements preservation during search
  - Original content restoration when search is cleared
- Search Results Navigation
  - Search results order maintenance during navigation
  - Empty search results handling
  - Search counter updates
- Multi-Tab Search Consistency
  - Independent search states across tabs
  - Handling tabs without search state

## Key Testing Concepts

### Layout Stability
Tests ensure that:
- Content doesn't shift horizontally when search is activated
- Scrollbar space is properly reserved to prevent layout shifts
- CSS classes properly control layout modes (flexbox for welcome, block for documents)

### DOM Preservation
Tests verify that:
- Original DOM structure is maintained during search highlighting
- Nested HTML elements are preserved during search operations
- Surgical DOM manipulation doesn't break existing structure
- Content can be properly restored when search is cleared

### Search State Management
Tests confirm that:
- Each tab maintains independent search state
- Search state persists across tab switches
- Search highlighting is properly applied and removed
- Search results navigation works correctly

### CSS Class Management
Tests validate that:
- `has-document-content` class is properly managed
- Layout modes switch correctly between welcome and document content
- CSS classes take precedence over inline styles
- Display properties are consistent based on content type

## Test Results
All 130 tests pass, including:
- 33 new tests specifically for search layout stability
- 98 existing tests that continue to pass
- Coverage for all major search and layout functionality

## Benefits
This comprehensive test suite provides:
1. **Regression Prevention:** Ensures search fixes don't break in future updates
2. **Layout Stability Assurance:** Confirms content doesn't shift during search operations
3. **Cross-Tab Functionality:** Verifies search works consistently across all tabs
4. **DOM Integrity:** Ensures DOM manipulation doesn't corrupt document structure
5. **Performance Validation:** Confirms search operations complete efficiently

## Usage
Run all tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

Run specific test files:
```bash
npx jest tests/search-layout-stability.test.js
npx jest tests/tab-layout-management.test.js
npx jest tests/search-state-management.test.js
```

## Maintenance
These tests should be run:
- Before any changes to search functionality
- Before any changes to CSS layout management
- Before any changes to tab switching logic
- As part of continuous integration to prevent regressions
